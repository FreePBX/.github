# Freedom to Communicate 🐸

The “Free” in FreePBX stands for Freedom. That’s because FreePBX, the world’s most popular open source IP PBX, gives users the tools to build a phone system tailored to their needs.

## Lay of the Land 🗺️

Since late 2023, the FreePBX project uses separate GitHub repositories for issue tracking, security reporting, and open source modules. 

## Contributions 💝

We welcome your ideas! Please submit open source issue reports via the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/FreePBX/issue-tracker), or for security issues please use the [Security Reporting repo](https://github.com/FreePBX/security-reporting?tab=security-ov-file).
